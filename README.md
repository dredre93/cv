## Technical Job Experience

5 Years experience developing PROGRESS OPEN EDGE desktop applications running on windows OS or linux distribution. 
Associated frontend developed on .NET componentes adapted to PROGRESS OPEN EDGE and JAVA RCP.

Beside of programming experience there is several stuff involved. Lets take Database administration for example specifically with PROGRESS OPEN EDGE but also database architecture in general. 


## Technical Leasure Time Experience

There are many programming languages, frameworks, libraries and communities you have to heard about. During working time and tough project deadlines you'll not get into it. So my purporse is to look beyond the box in leasure time. 

Writing web applications with C#, .ASP supported by RAZZOR framework and based on MVC architector was instructive.
From that point i challenged myself with further web technologies. Especially intressting is also the MVC framework symfony with PHP backend logic and all of the JavaScript, CSS and Bootstrap stuff in the front of the application. 

With this in mind i started to learn more about responsive web design and mobile friendly web application with REACT, JavaScript and Next.js with MaterialUi styled components in the frontend. The authentication and database handling with firebase brightened my day as it has reminded me to my first web app written in C# with authentication handling written by myself supported by the RAZZOR framework. 

In the end i come up with mobile applications. 
Learning GOOGLE's programming language DART combined with FLUTTER is still intressting and the list will still go on in future because there are such nice technologies out there i need to have a look at.
